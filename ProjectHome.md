MESMER is a scientific tool designed to identify characteristic structures or components in heterogenous solutions from bulk-average data. It does this by evolving a population of ensembles containing candidate components, selecting only ensembles that fit the available experimental data better than their peers. This robust genetic algorithm allows for the selection of just a few candidates even when there are thousands of possible components.

Currently, MESMER is in the testing and evaluation development stage, but if you are interested in using MESMER for your own work don't hesitate to contact the maintainer!
